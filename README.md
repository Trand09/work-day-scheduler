## Description 
This project is a work day planner that allows a user to play their work day out in hourly blocks. The application allows the user to input their daily tasks for each hour and save events in each hour block. Each hour block is color coded according to the time: Gray blocks mean that time has past, green blocks mean that the time is in the future, and red blocks mean the time is present.
